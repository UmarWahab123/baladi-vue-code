                  On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced
                  an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019
                  novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
                  The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019,
                  abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for
                  ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly,
                  this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or
                  “2019-nCoV”.

                  The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and

                  congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These
                  symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
                  become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don’t feel
                  unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease
                  without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6
                  people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops
                  difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying
                  medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or
                  diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People
                  with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
                  attention.

                  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause
                  illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline
                  coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                  coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect
                  people and can spread between people. This is suspected to
                  have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East
                  Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                  Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that
                  originated from animals and then spread to people. More
                  information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is
                  available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the
